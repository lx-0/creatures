nx generate @nrwl/angular:component components/my-component --project=frontend

I want to create a browser AI simulation, where creatures can interact with things like water and food and other creatures, live and mate and pass on their experiences to their children. I want that the creates individually learn success strategies and pass them on to their siblings.
There should also be a mechanism to select the strongest creatures, meaning they can die.
The simulation shall be watchable in the browser and current stats of each creature shall be shown on mouse hover.
The frontend shall be created with typescript, angular and pixijs. Tensorflow shall be used for the learning and choice making part of the creatures.
Can you give a brief example how to implement this

I also want communication with a backend to store statistics. can you show an example using nestjs?
